        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;6a. What do you think about the current condition of software development in bangladesh and how this differ from the other developed countries?
        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Also put a comment how we can improve ourselves as a giant digital developed nation in this field?
        <br/><pre>
            Most of our developers are just coder. They are expert in coding. Or, somehow, they know, how to code and develop.
            But, It's more important to know about the architecture, algorithm, and other diagrams for developing. Our Govt.
            costs a huge amount of money to train our young generation. But, It will be a huge loss if the quality control is
            not taken seriously. Most of the companies hires only developer. They don't give a damn to testing, QA, Security,
            architectures, algorithms. In some cases, developers do the other things, where in other countries, everything is
            well maintained.

            To improve ourselves, we have to maintain proper development process.
